## Hybrid_search_RAG

Hybrid search RAG combines traditional keyword-based search with advanced neural search techniques to deliver more accurate and relevant results. By integrating these cutting-edge tools, we can harness the strengths of both approaches to build a robust and efficient search system. An essential part of this is Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), a technique that combines the strengths of multiple rankers, ensuring that the most relevant results appear higher in the search rankings. RRF has significantly improved our search accuracy.

## Technical Stack:

PineconeDB: An advanced vector database that makes it easy to store, search, and manage high-dimensional vector embeddings.
LangChain: A powerful framework for building applications with language models.
Hugging Face (all-MiniLM-L6-v2): This state-of-the-art embedding model provides highly efficient and accurate sentence embeddings, crucial for semantic search.
BM25 Encoder: A classic and highly effective ranking function used in information retrieval.

## Key Highlights:

Enhanced Precision: By leveraging both BM25 and neural encoders, we achieve higher search precision and relevancy.
Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF): This technique ensures that the most relevant results appear higher in the search rankings by combining the strengths of multiple rankers, significantly improving search accuracy.
Versatility: The hybrid approach ensures robustness across various types of queries, from simple keyword searches to complex natural language queries.
Scalability: With PineconeDB's advanced vector management capabilities, our system can efficiently handle large-scale data.

## Why Hybrid Search?
Hybrid search RAG stands out because it provides the best of both worlds:

Keyword-based Search (BM25): Ideal for straightforward, exact match queries.
Neural Search (Hugging Face all-MiniLM-L6-v2): Excels at understanding context and semantic meaning, delivering results that are contextually relevant.
